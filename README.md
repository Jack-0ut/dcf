# Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Model for Stock Valuation üìäüíπ

Welcome to the **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Model**, a powerful tool built with **Flask** that allows you to project the intrinsic value of a stock based on its future cash flows. This project provides a simple yet effective way to assess whether a stock is overvalued or undervalued using financial modeling.

üöÄ **Key Features**:
- **Stock Ticker Input**: Enter the stock ticker of the company you're interested in.
- **Projection Years**: Specify the number of years you want to project for.
- **Predictions & Insights**: Receive a detailed analysis of the company's future cash flows, along with a prediction of the intrinsic stock price.
- **Interactive Flask App**: The model runs on a Flask-based web app where users can input data and see results in real-time.
